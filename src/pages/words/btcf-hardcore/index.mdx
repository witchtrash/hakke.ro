# b01lers CTF 22 - Hardcore pt. 1

This challenge was part of b01lers CTF 2022, under the crypto category. The challenge consisted of a `nc` address and port, and we also get the source code of the service running behind the socket. On connecting to the socket, we get the following output

```text
$ nc ctf.b01lers.com 9003

Select a difficulty (1/2):1

We're looking to find the secret behind this SHA1 hash <d578448067f47a44e1d97974492a07ca4b3f230ae70bb0f9129bb8d62d197703>. Lucki
ly for you, this socket takes a bitstring and predicts the dot product of the secret with that bit string (mod 2) with 100% accu
racy and sends you back the answer.
```

Let's look at the code.

```python
import numpy as np
from os import urandom
import binascii
import hashlib
from secret import FLAG1, FLAG2

# Helpers

def digest_to_array(digest):
    hex_digest = binascii.hexlify(digest)
    binary = bin(int(hex_digest, base=16)).lstrip('0b')
    binary = np.array(list(binary))

    # currently leading 0s are gone, add them back
    missing_zeros = np.zeros(256 - len(binary))
    binary = np.concatenate((missing_zeros, binary.astype(int)))

    return binary.astype(int)

def bitstring_to_bytes(s):
    return int(s, 2).to_bytes((len(s) + 7) // 8, byteorder='big')

####################################################################################

def generate_hardcore(secret, r):
    return int(np.sum(secret * r) % 2)

def predictor(r, probability = 1):
    x_r = (r.copy() != digest_to_array(FLAG))
    np.random.seed(x_r)
    chance = np.random.rand()

    prediction = 0
    if chance <= probability:
        prediction = generate_hardcore(digest_to_array(FLAG), r)
    else:
        prediction = 1 - generate_hardcore(digest_to_array(FLAG), r)

    return int(prediction)

def parse_input():
    bitstring = input()
    assert len(bitstring) == 256
    assert set(bitstring) <= set(["0", "1"])

    bitstring = bitstring_to_bytes(bitstring)
    array = digest_to_array(bitstring) % 2
    return array

def Level(probability):
    hasher = hashlib.sha256()
    hasher.update(FLAG)
    encrypted_secret = hasher.hexdigest()
    problem_statement = \
        f"We're looking to find the secret behind this SHA1 hash <{str(encrypted_secret)}>. " \
         "Luckily for you, this socket takes a bitstring and predicts the dot product " \
        f"of the secret with that bit string (mod 2) with {int(100*probability)}% accuracy and sends you back the answer.\n"

    print(problem_statement)
    while True:
        array = parse_input()
        if array is None:
            return
        print(predictor(array, probability = probability))

def main():
    global FLAG
    diff = int(input("Select a difficulty (1/2):"))
    if diff == 1:
        FLAG = FLAG1
        Level(1)
    if diff == 2:
        FLAG = FLAG2
        Level(0.9)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

So, the `FLAG` is hashed using `sha256`, and we get the signature of the secret. It takes a bitstring of length 256, and calculates the dot product of the bitstring with the secret, and returns the result `mod` 2.

So, what's a dot product? A dot product is an operation that takes two sequences of numbers of equal length, and returns a single number. So if we have some lists `a` and `b`, the dot product of those is basically

```python
a = [1, 0, 1, 1...]
b = [0, 1, 1, 1...]

n = 0
for i in range(256):
  n += a[i] * b[i]
```

Since we have full control of one of the vectors, we can effectively reverse what the secret is by constructing bitstrings that only extract one number at a time. Consider the case where we have some bitstring that looks like this

```python
b = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0 ]
```

Since we have a bit string that only has one `1` in it at some index `i`, we're effectively calculating

```python
n = 1 * b[i]
```

So what we can do is generate 256 bit strings, every bit string is just set to zeroes, and then we set `i` to `1`, where `i in range(256)`. Modifying the source we get and running this locally looks something like this

```python
def Level(probability):
    hasher = hashlib.sha256()
    hasher.update(FLAG)
    encrypted_secret = hasher.hexdigest()

    products = []

    for i in range(256):
        l = ["0" for _ in range(256)]
        l[i] = "1"

        s = "".join(l)

        array = parse_input(s)

        if array is None:
            return

        res = predictor(array, probability=probability)
        products.append(str(res))

    p = "".join(products)
    bytez = bitstring_to_bytes(p)

    print(bytez)
```

Running this with the `FLAG` set to `foobar` gives us the following result: `b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00foobar'`. poggers

Now we just have to run this against the `nc` service to extract the secret, which is a bit tricker, since we have to do the same thing except over sockets. We can cheat however by generating all the bitstrings into a text file, copying them all, and just pasting them into the `nc` service. This is somewhat easier than writing a socket listener, but I'm dumb.

```python
with open("strings.txt", "w") as f:
    for i in range(256):
        l = ["0" for _ in range(256)]
        l[i] = "1"
        s = "".join(l)
        f.write(f"{s}\n")

```

We can redirect the output from `netcat` into a file...

```
nc ctf.b01lers.com 9003 > out.txt 2>&1
```

...and then we can feed the output into the handy `bitstring_to_bytes` function we got from the source

```python
products = [ BIG ASS BITSTRING ]

p = "".join([str(p) for p in products])
bytez = bitstring_to_bytes(p)

print(bytez)
```

Running it we get

```python
python hardcore.py
b'bctf{do_you_like_hardcore_chals}'
```

Flag get!
